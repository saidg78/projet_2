# Speech Keyword Recognition Project

The project involves implementing a speech keyword recognition system using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and Edge Impulse. Users learn to collect audio data to train an artificial neural network capable of recognizing specific words such as "red," "green," and "yellow." Once trained, the model is deployed on the Arduino board, enabling the Nano 33 BLE Sense to detect these keywords in real-time from the integrated microphone input. The RGB LED on the board lights up upon successful keyword detection, creating an interactive and educational project that combines machine learning and Arduino hardware.

It's worth noting that the model achieved an accuracy of 67.9% with a loss of 0.75, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing speech keywords.

Step 1:Creating and Curating a Dataset

So, as you know the most important part is Datacollection. For collecting the data, I used my phone and I recorded 2 minutes for each class.
